# History-of-the-iphone
The iphone has been around almost as long as I have been alive and my project is about all the history behind the Apple logo we have all become very familiar with today.

# About the iphone

The iphone started way back in January 2007 and now they are on the 11th iteration of the phone called the iphone 11, 11 pro, and 11 pro max. **Steve Jobs** was the co-founder, chief executive and chairman of Apple. The type of popularity and sales Apple produced were unmatched and are still standing strong today.

# Future Development
With my future developments I'd have to go in and update everytime Apple comes out with a new iphone. Also along with adding all the future iphones I could add a section of the developers and a section of the companies that are partnered with Apple and their products like Beats Electronics. As Apple expands its technologies I could also expand my repository keeping up with everything they put out as far as iphones and there other products go. Another future development I could do is take the time and go through and list every single device Apple has made and the generations of each one in the past as well.
