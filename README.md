# Future Development
With my future developments I'd have to go in and update everytime Apple comes out with a new iphone. Also along with adding all the future iphones I could add a section of the developers and a section of the companies that are partnered with Apple and their products like Beats Electronics. As Apple expands its technologies I could also expand my repository keeping up with everything they put out as far as iphones and there other products go. Another future development I could do is take the time and go through and list every single device Apple has made and the generations of each one in the past as well.
