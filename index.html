<h1>History-of-the-iphone</h1>
<p>The iphone has been around almost as long as I have been alive and my project is about all the history behind the Apple logo we have all become very familiar with today.</p>  
> Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.

The type of popularity and sales Apple produced were unmatched and are still standing strong today.</p>

<h1>Future Development</h1> 
<p>With my future developments I'd have to go in and update everytime Apple comes out with a new iphone. 
Also along with adding all the future iphones I could add a section of the developers and a section of the companies that are partnered with Apple and their products like Beats Electronics. 
As Apple expands its technologies I could also expand my repository keeping up with everything they put out as far as iphones and there other products go. Another future development I could 
do is take the time and go through and list every single device Apple has made and the generations of each one in the past as well. </p>
